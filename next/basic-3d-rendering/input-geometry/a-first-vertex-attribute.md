In the [Hello Triangle](../hello-triangle.md) chapter, we were **hardcoding** the 3 vertex positions directly in the shader, but this obviously does not scale well. In this chapter, we see the **proper way** to feed vertex attributes as **input to the *vertex shader***.

Multiple options
----------------

Whichever method we adopt to **feed our render pipeline with data**, it goes through the creation of a **buffer** in which we **store vertex data**.

In chapter [*Our first shader*](../../getting-started/our-first-shader.md), we have seen how to bind a **storage buffer** to access a buffer from a shader. This approach **does work** (provided the storage buffer is read-only), using the `@builtin(vertex_index)` to know what part of the buffer to look at to get the position of the current vertex.

You know what? I'll **leave that option as an exercise** because at this stage you already know everything you need!

Instead, we investigate here **a second option**, which relies on the initial **vertex fetch** stage of the render pipeline. This is again a case where specifying more tightly the **usage** of our data helps the GPU better manage the memory, leading to better performance.

```{note}
On modern (higher end) desktop GPUs, there is not much of a performance difference between using a storage buffer and using the pipeline's vertex buffer. However, I strongly invite you to **keep in mind lower end devices** and mobile devices when developing your application ([there are good reasons for that](../../../appendices/keep-in-mind-lower-end-devices.md)).
```

Vertex shader input
-------------------

```{themed-figure} /images/a-first-vertex-attribute/we-are-here_{theme}.svg
:align: center

In this chapter, we study the very beginning of the render pipeline.
```

Remember that we do **not** control the way the `vs_main` function is invoked, the **fixed part** of the render pipeline does. However, we can **request** some input data by labeling the argument of the function with **WGSL attributes**.

```{important}
The term *attribute* is used for two different things. We talk about **WGSL attribute** to mean tokens of the form `@something` in a WGSL code, and about **vertex attribute** to mean an input of the vertex shader.
```

We already use a WGSL attribute in our vertex shader input actually, namely the `@builtin(vertex_index)` attribute:

```rust
@vertex
fn vs_main(@builtin(vertex_index) in_vertex_index: u32) -> /* [...] */ {
	//     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This is a WGSL attribute
	// [...]
}
```

This means that the argument `in_vertex_index` must be populated by the vertex fetch stage with the index of the current vertex.

```{note}
Attributes that are **built-in**, like `vertex_index`, are listed in [the WGSL documentation](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/wgsl/#builtin-values).
```

Instead of using a built-in input, we can **create our own**. For this we need to:

 1. Create a **buffer** to store the value of the input for each vertex; this data must be stored **on the GPU side**, of course.
 2. Tell the render pipeline **how to interpret** the raw buffer data when fetching an entry for each vertex. This is the vertex buffer **layout**.
 3. Set the vertex buffer in the render pass before the draw call.

On the shader side, we replace the vertex index argument with a new one:

```rust
@vertex
fn vs_main(@location(0) in_vertex_position: vec2f) -> /* [...] */ {
	//     ^^^^^^^^^^^^ This is a WGSL attribute
	// [...]
}
```

When used as input of the vertex shader, the `@location(0)` attribute means that this input variable is described by the first (index '0') **vertex attribute** in the `pipelineDesc.vertex.buffers` array.

```{note}
The type `vec2f` must comply with what we will declare in the **layout**. The argument name `in_vertex_position` is up to you, it is only local to the shader code!
```

The vertex shader becomes really simple in the end:

```{lit} rust, Vertex shader (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
fn vs_main(@location(0) in_vertex_position: vec2f) -> @builtin(position) vec4f {
	return vec4f(in_vertex_position, 0.0, 1.0);
}
```

```{lit} rust, Shader source literal (hidden, replace, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
const char* shaderSource = R"(
@vertex
{{Vertex shader}}

@fragment
{{Fragment shader}}
)";
```

```{lit} rust, Fragment shader (hidden, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
fn fs_main() -> @location(0) vec4f {
	return vec4f(0.0, 0.4, 1.0, 1.0);
}
```

Vertex Buffer
-------------

Let us first create the buffer that contains vertex data. We create a dedicated method `InitializeBuffers()` to define the CPU-side vertex data and create the GPU-side buffer:

```{lit} C++, InitializeBuffers method (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
bool Application::InitializeBuffers() {
	{{Define vertex data}}
	{{Create vertex buffer}}
	return true;
}
```

```{lit} C++, Application implementation (hidden, append, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
{{InitializeBuffers method}}
```

````{note}
Do not forget to declare this method in `Application.h` and to call it at the end of `Initialize()`:

```{lit} C++, Private methods (append, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
private: // Application methods
	bool InitializeBuffers();
```

```{lit} C++, Initialize (append, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// At the end of Initialize()
if (!InitializeBuffers()) return false;
```
````

For now we hard-code the **values of the vertex buffer** in the C++ source:

```{lit} C++, Define vertex data (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Vertex buffer data
// There are 2 floats per vertex, one for x and one for y.
// But in the end this is just a bunch of floats to the eyes of the GPU,
// the *layout* will tell how to interpret this.
std::vector<float> vertexData = {
	// x0, y0
	-0.45f, 0.5f,

	// x1, y1
	0.45f, 0.5f,

	// x2, y2
	0.0f, -0.5f
};

// We will declare vertexCount as a member of the Application class
m_vertexCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(vertexData.size() / 2);
```

The GPU-side vertex buffer is created **like any other buffer**, as introduced in the previous chapter. The **only difference** is that we must specify `BufferUsage::Vertex` in its `usage` field.

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Create vertex buffer
// Create vertex buffer
BufferDescriptor bufferDesc = Default;
bufferDesc.size = vertexData.size() * sizeof(float);
bufferDesc.usage = BufferUsage::CopyDst | BufferUsage::Vertex; // Vertex usage here!
m_vertexBuffer = m_device.createBuffer(bufferDesc);

// Upload geometry data to the buffer
m_queue.writeBuffer(m_vertexBuffer, 0, vertexData.data(), bufferDesc.size);
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Create vertex buffer (for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Create vertex buffer
WGPUBufferDescriptor bufferDesc = WGPU_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR_INIT;
bufferDesc.size = vertexData.size() * sizeof(float);
bufferDesc.usage = WGPUBufferUsage_CopyDst | WGPUBufferUsage_Vertex; // Vertex usage here!
m_vertexBuffer = wgpuDeviceCreateBuffer(m_device, &bufferDesc);

// Upload geometry data to the buffer
wgpuQueueWriteBuffer(m_queue, m_vertexBuffer, 0, vertexData.data(), bufferDesc.size);
```
````

We declare `m_vertexBuffer` and `m_vertexCount` as a members of our `Application` class:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Application attributes (append)
private: // Application attributes
	wgpu::Buffer m_vertexBuffer;
	uint32_t m_vertexCount;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Application attributes (append, for tangle root "Vanilla")
private: // Application attributes
	WGPUBuffer m_vertexBuffer;
	uint32_t m_vertexCount;
```
````

And of course we release the buffer when the application terminates:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Terminate (prepend)
// At the beginning of Terminate()
m_vertexBuffer.release();
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Terminate (prepend, for tangle root "Vanilla")
// At the beginning of Terminate()
wgpuBufferRelease(m_vertexBuffer);
```
````

**WIP**

Vertex Buffer Layout
--------------------

For the *vertex fetch* stage to transform this **raw data** from the vertex buffer **into what the vertex shader expects**, we need to specify a `VertexBufferLayout` in `pipelineDesc.vertex.buffers`:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Describe vertex buffers
// Vertex fetch
VertexBufferLayout vertexBufferLayout = Default;
{{Describe the vertex buffer layout}}

// When describing the render pipeline:
pipelineDesc.vertex.bufferCount = 1;
pipelineDesc.vertex.buffers = &vertexBufferLayout;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Describe vertex buffers (for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Vertex fetch
WGPUVertexBufferLayout vertexBufferLayout = WGPU_VERTEX_BUFFER_LAYOUT_INIT;
{{Describe the vertex buffer layout}}

// When describing the render pipeline:
pipelineDesc.vertex.bufferCount = 1;
pipelineDesc.vertex.buffers = &vertexBufferLayout;
```
````

```{lit} C++, Describe render pipeline (prepend, hidden, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
{{Describe vertex buffers}}
```

Note that a given render pipeline **may use more than one** vertex buffer. On the other hand, the **same vertex buffer** can contain **multiple vertex attributes**.

```{note}
This is why the `maxVertexAttributes` and `maxVertexBuffers` device limits are different concepts, see below.
```

So, within our vertex buffer layout, we specify **how many attributes** it contains and **detail each of them**. In our case, there is only the position attribute:


````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Describe the vertex buffer layout
VertexAttribute positionAttrib = Default;
{{Describe the position attribute}}

vertexBufferLayout.attributeCount = 1;
vertexBufferLayout.attributes = &positionAttrib;

{{Describe buffer stride and step mode}}
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Describe the vertex buffer layout (for tangle root "Vanilla")
WGPUVertexAttribute positionAttrib = WGPU_VERTEX_ATTRIBUTE_INIT;
{{Describe the position attribute}}

vertexBufferLayout.attributeCount = 1;
vertexBufferLayout.attributes = &positionAttrib;

{{Describe buffer stride and step mode}}
```
````

### For each attribute

We can now configure our vertex attribute:

 - The value of `shaderLocation` must be the **same** as what specifies the **WGSL attribute** `@location(...)` in the vertex shader.
 - The **format** `Float32x2` corresponds at the same time to the type `vec2f` in the shader and to the sequence of 2 floats in the vertex buffer data.
 - The **offset** tells where the sequence of position values start in the raw vertex buffer. In our case it starts at the beginning (offset 0). It is **non null** when the same vertex buffer **contains multiple attributes**.

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Describe the position attribute
// == For each attribute, describe its layout, i.e., how to interpret the raw data ==
// Corresponds to @location(...)
positionAttrib.shaderLocation = 0;
// Means vec2f in the shader
positionAttrib.format = VertexFormat::Float32x2;
// Index of the first element
positionAttrib.offset = 0;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Describe the position attribute (for tangle root "Vanilla")
// == For each attribute, describe its layout, i.e., how to interpret the raw data ==
// Corresponds to @location(...)
positionAttrib.shaderLocation = 0;
// Means vec2f in the shader
positionAttrib.format = WGPUVertexFormat_Float32x2;
// Index of the first element
positionAttrib.offset = 0;
```
````

### For the whole vertex buffer

Attributes coming from the same vertex buffer **share some properties**:

 - The **stride** is a common concept in buffer manipulation: it designates the number of bytes between two consecutive elements. In our case, the positions are **contiguous** so the stride is equal to the size of a `vec2f`, but this will change when adding more attributes in the same buffer, if attributes are **interleaved**.

 - Finally the `stepMode` is set to `Vertex` to mean that **each value** from the buffer corresponds to a **different vertex**. The step mode is set to `Instance` when each value is **shared by all vertices of the same instance** (i.e., copy) of the shape (we'll see instancing later on).

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Describe buffer stride and step mode
// == Common to attributes from the same buffer ==
vertexBufferLayout.arrayStride = 2 * sizeof(float);
vertexBufferLayout.stepMode = VertexStepMode::Vertex;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Describe buffer stride and step mode (for tangle root "Vanilla")
// == Common to attributes from the same buffer ==
vertexBufferLayout.arrayStride = 2 * sizeof(float);
vertexBufferLayout.stepMode = WGPUVertexStepMode_Vertex;
```
````

Render Pass
-----------

The last change we need to apply is to "connect" the vertex buffer to the pipeline's vertex buffer layout **when encoding the render pass**:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Draw a triangle (replace)
renderPass.setPipeline(m_pipeline);

// Set vertex buffer while encoding the render pass
renderPass.setVertexBuffer(0, m_vertexBuffer, 0, m_vertexBuffer.getSize());

// We use the `m_vertexCount` variable instead of hard-coding the vertex count
renderPass.draw(m_vertexCount, 1, 0, 0);
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Draw a triangle (replace, for tangle root "Vanilla")
wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetPipeline(renderPass, m_pipeline);

// Set vertex buffer while encoding the render pass
wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetVertexBuffer(renderPass, 0, m_vertexBuffer, 0, wgpuBufferGetSize(m_vertexBuffer));

// We use the `m_vertexCount` variable instead of hard-coding the vertex count
wgpuRenderPassEncoderDraw(renderPass, m_vertexCount, 1, 0, 0);
```
````

And we get... exactly the same triangle as before. Except now we can very **easily add some geometry**:

```{lit} C++, Define vertex data (replace, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Vertex buffer data
// There are 2 floats per vertex, one for x and one for y.
std::vector<float> vertexData = {
	// Define a first triangle:
	-0.45f, 0.5f,
	0.45f, 0.5f,
	0.0f, -0.5f,

	// Add a second triangle:
	0.47f, 0.47f,
	0.25f, 0.0f,
	0.69f, 0.0f
};

m_vertexCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(vertexData.size() / 2);
```

**TODO**

Conclusion
----------

We have seen in this chapter how to use **GPU buffers** to feed data as **input** to the vertex shader, and thus to the whole rasterization pipeline. We will refine this in the next chapter by adding **additional attributes**.
