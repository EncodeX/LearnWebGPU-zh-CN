Introduction
------------

### Motivation

If we look at our current shader, we see some **hard-coded** constants:

```rust
let ratio = 640.0 / 480.0;
let offset = vec2f(-0.6875, -0.463);
```

This is not very satisfying, what happens when we want to move the object during the execution of the application? Or change the ratio because the user resized the window?

> ‚òùÔ∏è We could dynamically change the shader code and rebuild a new shader module!

It would work, but **building a shader module takes time**. A lot of time, if we compare it to the budget for rendering a single frame (typically a 60th of a second). Imagine we want to **animate** our scene and thus change the `offset` each frame!

This is why a proper solution is to use a **uniform variable**.

### Definition

A uniform is a global variable in a shader whose value is loaded from a GPU buffer. We say that it is **bound** to the buffer.

Its value is **uniform** across the different vertices and fragment of **a given call** to `draw`, but it can be changed from one call to another by **updating** the value of the buffer it is *bound* to.

To use a uniform, we need to:

 1. Declare the uniform in the **shader**.
 2. Create the **buffer** it is bound to.
 3. Configure the properties of the **binding** (a.k.a. the binding's **layout**).
 4. Create a **bind group**.

### Device limits

In this chapter, we will require the following limits to be set up for our device:

```{lit} C++, Other device limits (append, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// We use at most 1 bind group for now
requiredLimits.limits.maxBindGroups = 1;
// We use at most 1 uniform buffer per stage
requiredLimits.limits.maxUniformBuffersPerShaderStage = 1;
// Uniform structs have a size of maximum 16 float (more than what we need)
requiredLimits.limits.maxUniformBufferBindingSize = 16 * 4;
```

Shader side
-----------

In order to animate our scene, we create a uniform called `uTime` that we update each frame with the current time, expressed in second (as provided by `glfwGetTime()`).

```{note}
I usually **prefix** uniform variables with a 'u' so that it is easy to figure out when reading a long shader **when a variable is a uniform** rather than a local variable.
```

As I said, a uniform is a global variable, so we can declare it in the first line of our shader. A simple variable declaration in WGSL looks as follows:

```{lit} rust, Declare uniforms (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Simple variable declaration
var uTime: f32;
```

The `var` keyword can be labeled with an **address space**, which controls how the variable is stored in the GPU (see [Memory Model](/appendices/memory-model.md)). Here we state that the variable is stored in the *uniform* address space:

```{lit} rust, Declare uniforms (replace, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Variable in the *uniform* address space
var<uniform> uTime: f32;
```

Now we need to tell to which **buffer** the uniform is **bound**. This is done by specifying a **binding index** with the `@binding(...)` WGSL attribute.

```{lit} rust, Declare uniforms (replace, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Specify which binding index the uniform is attached to
@binding(0) var<uniform> uTime: f32;
```

We will then define in the C++ code which buffer is attached to the binding #0. And actually, bindings are organized in **bind groups**, so the binding of a uniform is specified by also providing an `@group(...)` attribute:

```{lit} rust, Declare uniforms (replace, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// The memory location of the uniform is given by a pair of a *bind group* and a *binding*
@group(0) @binding(0) var<uniform> uTime: f32;
```

We are now done with the declaration of the uniform variable, we can use it like any other variable in our shader:

```{lit} rust, Shader prelude (append, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// We add the declaration of 'uTime' to the shader prelude
{{Declare uniforms}}
```

```{lit} rust, Vertex shader (replace, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
fn vs_main(in: VertexInput) -> VertexOutput {
	var out: VertexOutput;
	let ratio = 640.0 / 480.0;

	// We now move the scene depending on the time!
	var offset = vec2f(-0.6875, -0.463);
	offset += 0.3 * vec2f(cos(uTime), sin(uTime));

	out.position = vec4f(in.position.x + offset.x, (in.position.y + offset.y) * ratio, 0.0, 1.0);
	out.color = in.color;
	return out;
}
```

```{hint}
If you are not familiar with the [trigonometric functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions) like `cos` and `sin`, be aware that the position $(\cos(a), \sin(a))$ is the point on the circle of radius $1$ at angle $a$ (expressed in radians). Thus, this formula makes the triangle **move along a circle** over time. It is multiplied by $0.3$ in order to decrease the radius of this circle.
```

Uniform buffer
--------------

The uniform buffer is created like any other buffer, except we must specify `BufferUsage::Uniform` in its `usage` field. We only need it to contain 1 float for now, but **buffer size needs to be aligned to 16 bytes**, so we create a buffer of 4 floats (1 float uses 4 bytes).

We first declare our `uniformBuffer` in the `Application` class attributes:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Application attributes (append)
private: // Application attributes
	Buffer uniformBuffer;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Application attributes (append, for tangle root "Vanilla")
private: // Application attributes
	WGPUBuffer uniformBuffer;
```
````

We then create the buffer during initialization:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Create uniform buffer
// Create uniform buffer (reusing bufferDesc from other buffer creations)
// The buffer will only contain 1 float with the value of uTime
// then 3 floats left empty but needed by alignment constraints
bufferDesc.size = 4 * sizeof(float);

// Make sure to flag the buffer as BufferUsage::Uniform
bufferDesc.usage = BufferUsage::CopyDst | BufferUsage::Uniform;

bufferDesc.mappedAtCreation = false;
uniformBuffer = device.createBuffer(bufferDesc);
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Create uniform buffer (for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Create uniform buffer (reusing bufferDesc from other buffer creations)
// The buffer will only contain 1 float with the value of uTime
// then 3 floats left empty but needed by alignment constraints
bufferDesc.size = 4 * sizeof(float);

// Make sure to flag the buffer as BufferUsage::Uniform
bufferDesc.usage = WGPUBufferUsage_CopyDst | WGPUBufferUsage_Uniform;

bufferDesc.mappedAtCreation = false;
uniformBuffer = wgpuDeviceCreateBuffer(device, &bufferDesc);
```
````

Then use `Queue::writeBuffer` to upload a value in the first float of the buffer:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Upload uniform values
float currentTime = 1.0f;
queue.writeBuffer(uniformBuffer, 0, &currentTime, sizeof(float));
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Upload uniform values (for tangle root "Vanilla")
float currentTime = 1.0f;
wgpuQueueWriteBuffer(queue, uniformBuffer, 0, &currentTime, sizeof(float));
```
````

To summarize, we put this at the end of `Application::InitializeBuffers()`:

```{lit} C++, InitializeBuffers method (replace, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
void Application::InitializeBuffers() {
	// 1. Load from disk into CPU-side vectors pointData and indexData
	{{Load geometry data from file}}

	// 2. Create GPU buffers and upload data to them
	{{Create point buffer}}
	{{Create index buffer}}

	// 3. Create and fill uniform buffer <-- HERE
	{{Create uniform buffer}}
	{{Upload uniform values}}
}
```

`````{note}
Do not forget to release these buffer in the `Terminate()` method:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Terminate (prepend)
uniformBuffer.release();
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Terminate (prepend, for tangle root "Vanilla")
wgpuBufferRelease(uniformBuffer);
```
````
`````

Binding configuration
---------------------

If you try to run your program now, you will hit a device error stating that some bind group referenced in the shader is **incompatible** with the expected bind group layout. What does this mean?

There are two steps in the actual connection of the buffer to the uniform. One is to **declare in the pipeline** that we want a binding, and how exactly. This is the binding **layout**. And the second one is to create the bind group and enable it (see next section).

```{note}
This follows the same spirit than the distinction between the *vertex buffer* and the *vertex buffer layout*.
```

### Pipeline layout

The binding layout is specified through the `PipelineLayout` part of the pipeline descriptor. The pipeline layout describes how all the **resources** used by the render pipeline must be bound.

A resource is either a texture or a buffer, and its layout specifies to which index it is bound to and properties like whether it is accessed as read-only or write-only, etc.

So far, we were implicitly using an automatic layout by setting `pipelineDesc.layout`, but from now on we will explicitly declare what resources our pipeline expects:

```{lit} C++, Describe pipeline layout (replace, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
{{Create pipeline layout}}

// Assign the PipelineLayout to the RenderPipelineDescriptor's layout field
pipelineDesc.layout = layout;
```

When creating this pipeline layout, we may define multiple **bind groups**, and a bind group contains multiple **bindings**:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Create pipeline layout
{{Define bindingLayout}}

// Create a bind group layout
BindGroupLayoutDescriptor bindGroupLayoutDesc{};
bindGroupLayoutDesc.entryCount = 1;
bindGroupLayoutDesc.entries = &bindingLayout;
bindGroupLayout = device.createBindGroupLayout(bindGroupLayoutDesc);

// Create the pipeline layout
PipelineLayoutDescriptor layoutDesc{};
layoutDesc.bindGroupLayoutCount = 1;
layoutDesc.bindGroupLayouts = (WGPUBindGroupLayout*)&bindGroupLayout;
layout = device.createPipelineLayout(layoutDesc);
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Create pipeline layout (for tangle root "Vanilla")
{{Define bindingLayout}}

// Create a bind group layout
WGPUBindGroupLayoutDescriptor bindGroupLayoutDesc{};
bindGroupLayoutDesc.nextInChain = nullptr;
bindGroupLayoutDesc.entryCount = 1;
bindGroupLayoutDesc.entries = &bindingLayout;
bindGroupLayout = wgpuDeviceCreateBindGroupLayout(device, &bindGroupLayoutDesc);

// Create the pipeline layout
WGPUPipelineLayoutDescriptor layoutDesc{};
layoutDesc.nextInChain = nullptr;
layoutDesc.bindGroupLayoutCount = 1;
layoutDesc.bindGroupLayouts = &bindGroupLayout;
layout = wgpuDeviceCreatePipelineLayout(device, &layoutDesc);
```
````

Importantly, like any object created with a `createSomething` procedure, layouts **must be released** once we no longer use them. Hence we define them as class attributes.

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Application attributes (append)
private: // Application attributes
	PipelineLayout layout;
	BindGroupLayout bindGroupLayout;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Application attributes (append, for tangle root "Vanilla")
private: // Application attributes
	WGPUPipelineLayout layout;
	WGPUBindGroupLayout bindGroupLayout;
```
````

We can then release them in `Application::Terminate()`:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Terminate (prepend)
layout.release();
bindGroupLayout.release();
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Terminate (prepend, for tangle root "Vanilla")
wgpuPipelineLayoutRelease(layout);
wgpuBindGroupLayoutRelease(bindGroupLayout);
```
````

Retaining `bindGroupLayout` is also needed when we create the bind group that goes with it.

### Binding layout

The `BindGroupLayoutEntry` could have been called `BindingLayout` imho. The first setting is the binding index, as used in the shader's `@binding` attribute. Then the `visibility` field tells which stage requires access to this resource, so that it is not needlessly provided to all stages.

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Define bindingLayout
// Define binding layout (don't forget to = Default)
BindGroupLayoutEntry bindingLayout = Default;

// The binding index as used in the @binding attribute in the shader
bindingLayout.binding = 0;

// The stage that needs to access this resource
bindingLayout.visibility = ShaderStage::Vertex;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Define bindingLayout (for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Define binding layout
WGPUBindGroupLayoutEntry bindingLayout{};
setDefault(bindingLayout);

// The binding index as used in the @binding attribute in the shader
bindingLayout.binding = 0;

// The stage that needs to access this resource
bindingLayout.visibility = WGPUShaderStage_Vertex;
```

I suggest you create a function to initialize the bind group layout entry somewhere, like we did for `WGPULimits`:

```{lit} C++, setDefault for WGPUBindGroupLayoutEntry (for tangle root "Vanilla")
void setDefault(WGPUBindGroupLayoutEntry &bindingLayout) {
	bindingLayout.buffer.nextInChain = nullptr;
	bindingLayout.buffer.type = WGPUBufferBindingType_Undefined;
	bindingLayout.buffer.hasDynamicOffset = false;

	bindingLayout.sampler.nextInChain = nullptr;
	bindingLayout.sampler.type = WGPUSamplerBindingType_Undefined;

	bindingLayout.storageTexture.nextInChain = nullptr;
	bindingLayout.storageTexture.access = WGPUStorageTextureAccess_Undefined;
	bindingLayout.storageTexture.format = WGPUTextureFormat_Undefined;
	bindingLayout.storageTexture.viewDimension = WGPUTextureViewDimension_Undefined;

	bindingLayout.texture.nextInChain = nullptr;
	bindingLayout.texture.multisampled = false;
	bindingLayout.texture.sampleType = WGPUTextureSampleType_Undefined;
	bindingLayout.texture.viewDimension = WGPUTextureViewDimension_Undefined;
}
```

```{lit} C++, InitializePipeline method (prepend, hidden, for tangle root "Vanilla")
// We place this before InitializePipeline
{{setDefault for WGPUBindGroupLayoutEntry}}
```
````

The remaining of the binding layout depends on the type of resource. We fill either the `buffer` field or the `sampler` and `texture` fields or the `storageTexture` field. In our case it is a buffer:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Define bindingLayout (append)
bindingLayout.buffer.type = BufferBindingType::Uniform;
bindingLayout.buffer.minBindingSize = 4 * sizeof(float);
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Define bindingLayout (append, for tangle root "Vanilla")
bindingLayout.buffer.type = WGPUBufferBindingType_Uniform;
bindingLayout.buffer.minBindingSize = 4 * sizeof(float);
```
````

```{important}
Notice how I initialized the binding layout object with `= Default` above. It is important because it sets in particular the `buffer`, `sampler`, `texture` and `storageTexture` uses to `Undefined` so that only the resource type we set up is used.
```

Bind group
----------

### Creation

A bind group contains the actual bindings. The structure of a bind group mirrors the bind group layout prescribed in the render pipeline and actually connects it to resources. This way, the same pipeline can be reused as is in multiple draw calls depending on different variants of the resources.

The bind group is again an object that we want to keep after initialization (we use it in the main loop), so we declare it at the **class level**:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Application attributes (append)
private: // Application attributes
	BindGroup bindGroup;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Application attributes (append, for tangle root "Vanilla")
private: // Application attributes
	WGPUBindGroup bindGroup;
```
````

A bind group must follow the same structure as its layout:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Create bind group
// Create a binding
BindGroupEntry binding{};
{{Setup binding}}

// A bind group contains one or multiple bindings
BindGroupDescriptor bindGroupDesc{};
bindGroupDesc.layout = bindGroupLayout;
// There must be as many bindings as declared in the layout!
bindGroupDesc.entryCount = 1;
bindGroupDesc.entries = &binding;
bindGroup = device.createBindGroup(bindGroupDesc);
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Create bind group (for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Create a binding
WGPUBindGroupEntry binding{};
binding.nextInChain = nullptr;
{{Setup binding}}

// A bind group contains one or multiple bindings
WGPUBindGroupDescriptor bindGroupDesc{};
bindGroupDesc.nextInChain = nullptr;
bindGroupDesc.layout = bindGroupLayout;
// There must be as many bindings as declared in the layout!
bindGroupDesc.entryCount = 1;
bindGroupDesc.entries = &binding;
bindGroup = wgpuDeviceCreateBindGroup(device, &bindGroupDesc);
```
````

And we release the bind group in `Application::Terminate()`:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Terminate (prepend)
bindGroup.release();
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Terminate (prepend, for tangle root "Vanilla")
wgpuBindGroupRelease(bindGroup);
```
````

The content of the binding itself is quite straightforward:

```{lit} C++, Setup binding (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// The index of the binding (the entries in bindGroupDesc can be in any order)
binding.binding = 0;
// The buffer it is actually bound to
binding.buffer = uniformBuffer;
// We can specify an offset within the buffer, so that a single buffer can hold
// multiple uniform blocks.
binding.offset = 0;
// And we specify again the size of the buffer.
binding.size = 4 * sizeof(float);
```

```{note}
The fields `binding.sampler` and `binding.textureView` are only needed when the binding layout uses them.
```

Note that unlike the creation of the bind group **layout**, the creation of the bind group must come **after the creation of the resources** that it binds! I thus suggest we introduce a new initialization method:

```{lit} C++, InitializeBindGroups method (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
void Application::InitializeBindGroups() {
	{{Create bind group}}
}
```

```{lit} C++, Application implementation (append, hidden, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Add this in the main file
{{InitializeBindGroups method}}
```

As usual, we declare the method in the application declaration:

```{lit} C++, Private methods (append, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
private: // Application methods
	void InitializeBindGroups();
```

And we initialize the bind group **after** everything else:

```{lit} C++, Initialize (append, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// At the end of Initialize()
InitializeBindGroups();
```

### Usage

Okay, we are now ready to connect the dots! It is as simple as setting the bind group to use **before the draw call**, in `Application::MainLoop()`:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Use Render Pass (replace)
renderPass.setPipeline(pipeline);
renderPass.setVertexBuffer(0, pointBuffer, 0, pointBuffer.getSize());
renderPass.setIndexBuffer(indexBuffer, IndexFormat::Uint16, 0, indexBuffer.getSize());

// Set binding group here!
renderPass.setBindGroup(0, bindGroup, 0, nullptr);

renderPass.drawIndexed(indexCount, 1, 0, 0, 0);
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Use Render Pass (replace, for tangle root "Vanilla")
wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetPipeline(renderPass, pipeline);
wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetVertexBuffer(renderPass, 0, pointBuffer, 0, wgpuBufferGetSize(pointBuffer));
wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetIndexBuffer(renderPass, indexBuffer, WGPUIndexFormat_Uint16, 0, wgpuBufferGetSize(indexBuffer));

// Set binding group here!
wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetBindGroup(renderPass, 0, bindGroup, 0, nullptr);

wgpuRenderPassEncoderDrawIndexed(renderPass, indexCount, 1, 0, 0, 0);
```
````

It should be working already, though not moving because the content of the uniform buffer **does not change yet**. What we need is to update them in the main loop:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Update uniform buffer
// Update uniform buffer
float t = static_cast<float>(glfwGetTime()); // glfwGetTime returns a double
queue.writeBuffer(uniformBuffer, 0, &t, sizeof(float));
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Update uniform buffer (for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Update uniform buffer
float t = static_cast<float>(glfwGetTime()); // glfwGetTime returns a double
wgpuQueueWriteBuffer(queue, uniformBuffer, 0, &t, sizeof(float));
```
````

We place this for instance at the beginning of `Application::MainLoop()`:

```{lit} C++, Main loop content (prepend, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Right after glfwPollEvents():
{{Update uniform buffer}}
```
